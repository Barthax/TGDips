Text files and supporting batch files created from analysing MAME INPs at TwinGalaxies.com.  To use, copy the batch folder content to some where else on your hard drive and then follow the instructions in the forum discussion available at http://www.twingalaxies.com/showthread.php/139635-Barthax-s-MAME-batch-file - changing the checkconf.bat (not the check.bat).  The checkconf.bat holds a duplicate of the variables and by changing the variables in this file (not check.bat) you can be sure your local environment needs are maintained by only updating the check.bat.
