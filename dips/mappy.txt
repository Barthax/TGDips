NOTES:
DIPs are shown by the game (very briefly) during boot up starting around frame 780.  Any changes to the DIP settings after this will not take effect.
Since 0.173, the conditional DIPs feature of this game affects WolfMAME's inpview. Verify settings with caution! ["Lives" affects "Bonus_Life"]
