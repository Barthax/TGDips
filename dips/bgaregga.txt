- 0.117u1: Alex Jackson added clone 'Battle Garegga - Type 2 (Europe / USA / Japan / Asia) (Sat Mar 2 1996)'. Reorganized the Battle Garegga sets in a more sensible fashion.

NOTES:
Difficulty & Timer settings Medium were both renamed to Normal in 0.141u4.
Since 0.173, the conditional DIPs feature of this game affects WolfMAME's inpview. Verify settings with caution! [Machine Configuration setting "Region" affects "Bonus_Life" DIP]
If Service Mode (F1+F2) is entered DURING RECORDING, DIP settings used for the performance can be displayed - this may assist verification. However, doing so AFTER PLAYBACK has ended will only display the viewer's local DIP settings, not those used for the performance.
