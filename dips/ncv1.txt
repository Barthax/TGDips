MAME History:
- 0.188: YGV608 video accessors are 8-bits not 16. Moved a few statics out from r/w handlers. Converted ports to AM_DEVICE. Log registers into own space, handling will follow up. Added CRTC function and moved irqs in handler callbacks. Added preliminary raster irq hookup (limited usage in NCV2). Moved YGV608 base address out of legacy switch case and ROZ registers out of the legacy code. Return h/vblank status bits. Misc IRQ changes. Address pointer clean-ups. Silence some ports in driver. YYGV608 pattern name table pointer access, log mosaic and added border color (makes the POST screens to be black and not green) [Angelo Salese]. Added 3rd button. Changed VSync to 58.557786 Hz.
