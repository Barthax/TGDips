NOTES:
Difficulty & Timer settings Medium were both renamed to Normal in 0.141u4.
If Service Mode (F1+F2) is entered DURING RECORDING, DIP settings used for the performance can be displayed - this may assist verification. However, doing so AFTER PLAYBACK has ended will only display the viewer's local DIP settings, not those used for the performance.
