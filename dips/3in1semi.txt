MAME History:
- 0.164: Changed description to 'New HyperMan (3-in-1 with Cookie & Bibi & HyperMan)'. Note: Previously we thought that 'XESS - The New Revolution' was the title of the 3-in-1 game, but infact it's just another team name, Gaia shows it too. The actual game doesn't seem to have a proper title indicating there are 3 games within it, only the New HyperMan title screen [David Haywood].
