Note: Service Mode can only be entered by enabling the Service DIP Switch and then resetting so this is not something that would be recorded in an INP.  Additionally, Service Mode only permits a read-only view of the DIP Switch current settings (which will include the Service DIP switch being enabled in DIP-SW2).
