Note: do not use Service Mode after playback as it will only reflect local configuration not the recording.  Service Mode is accessed via the DIP Switch.  Service Mode requires a restart thus cannot be recorded in an INP.  Navigation is with P1 Up & Down; P1 Button 1 to select.  Sub-sections typically require an exit combination of P1 Start and P2 Start simultaneously.
