Note: the rules were written for 0.106 and indicate all Unknown switches be off.  One of those switches governs the bonus life setting - the Off setting matches the 20K & 100K setting of newer MAME versions.  One of the other switches is now known to be the Invincibility (Cheat) switch and is off in the rules.
