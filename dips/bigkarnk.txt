Note: do not check Service Mode after playback as it will only reflect the local configuration, not the recording.  Service Mode is accessed by enabling the DIP switch or with Service button (F2) which toggles the DIP, then resetting the machine which prevents this from being recorded. Service Mode is a series of non-interactive screens followed by an input checker which is interactive.  P1 Button 1 cycles through the screens.
