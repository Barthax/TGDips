Note 1: Between 2005 and 2016 the Pac-Man "Points [TG settings]" rules only permitted the puckman ROM set.  Prior to 2005, only the pacman ROM set was permitted.  2016 has muddied the waters.
Note 2: do not use Service Mode (F2) to check after playback as it will have reverted to localised settings.
