From MAMEINFO.DAT:
- 0.222: Increased the length of the Namco 54XX IRQ to fix Bosconian shot sound regression. Fixed tilemap offset problem. Added 'Star Destroyer' sub title to description. Note: Is the screen horizontal resolution maybe 285? PCB videos do show a slightly larger right border though. Bullet vs tilemap offsets are correct when compared with PCB videos (both playfield area, and radar area). Bullet vs sprite offsets are also correct. The radar area is offset by 3 pixels, also confirmed with PCB video when it does the VRAM check [hap]. Changed description to 'Bosconian - Star Destroyer (new version)', (Midway, new version) to 'Bosconian - Star Destroyer (Midway, new version)', (Midway, old version) to 'Bosconian - Star Destroyer (Midway, old version)', (old version) to 'Bosconian - Star Destroyer (old version)' and (older version) to 'Bosconian - Star Destroyer (older version)'.
- 0.249: Virtvic, Porchy and The Dumping Union added Bosconian - Star Destroyer (version 5). Fixed rom names. Changed (new version) to clone 'Bosconian - Star Destroyer (version 3)', (old version) to 'Bosconian - Star Destroyer (version 1, newer)' and (older version) to 'Bosconian - Star Destroyer (version 1, older)'. Renamed (bosco) to (bosco3), (boscoo) to (bosco1) and (boscoo2) to (bosco1o).
