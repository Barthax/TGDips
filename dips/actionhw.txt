Note: it is impossible to change the difficulty and retain the setting due to unemulated EEPROM issues.  (Confirmed to 0.250.)  The settings menu defaults to Easy difficulty is therefore likely to be the only playable difficulty option.  However, without referencing actual hardware play examples of other difficulties, Easy is only an assumption.
