MAME History:
- 0.119u1: Stephane Humbert added Mario Bros. (US, set 1). Fixed dipswitches. Changed 'Mario Bros. (US)' to clone '(US, set 2)'. Renamed (mario) to (marioo) and (mariojp) to (marioj).
- 0.132u3: Mr Goodwraith, Smitdogg and Dumping Union added Mario Bros. (US, Revision F). Fixed rom names. Changed (US, set 1) to clone 'Mario Bros. (US, Revision E)' and clone (US, set 2) to clone 'Mario Bros. (US, Unknown Rev)'. Renamed (mario) to (marioe).
- 0.193: Verified Mario Bros. (US, Unknown Rev) as revision G and identified the unknown PROM as the main cpu memory map decoding PROM [Bryan McPhail]. Changed clone (US, Unknown Rev) to parent 'Mario Bros. (US, Revision G)'. Renamed (mario) to (mariof) and (marioo) to (mario).

NOTE: Reversed difficulty (MED <-> HARD) reported at 0.106 (and most likely earlier) appears to have been fixed around 0.121, though can only find anecdotal reports and no documented confirmation of this.
      This SHOULD NOT BE relevant to any future tracks that may be created for this clone, as the difficulty fix was prior to this set being supported by MAME.
