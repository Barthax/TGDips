NOTES:
At 0.111u4, 'Bonus_Life' was combined & renamed from two previously 'Unknown' DIPs (0x10 & 0x20), but labels were incorrect, This was later fixed at 0.122u8.
For track compatibility, the correctly translated 'Bonus_Life' setting is as follows:
0.112-0.122: Bonus_Life = No Bonus
0.123+: Bonus_Life = 5000
All other DIPs are per current rule set. This will award a bonus life at 5000 in all cases.
