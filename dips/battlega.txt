NOTES:
Difficulty Medium was renamed to Normal at about 0.142
Since 0.173, the conditional DIPs feature of this game affects WolfMAME's inpview. Verify settings with caution! [Machine Configuration setting "Region" affects "Bonus_Life" DIP]
If Service Mode (F1+F2) is entered DURING RECORDING, DIP settings used for the performance can be displayed - this may assist verification. However, doing so AFTER PLAYBACK has ended will only display the viewer's local DIP settings, not those used for the performance.
