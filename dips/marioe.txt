MAME History:
- 0.119u1: Stephane Humbert added Mario Bros. (US, set 1). Fixed dipswitches. Changed 'Mario Bros. (US)' to clone '(US, set 2)'. Renamed (mario) to (marioo) and (mariojp) to (marioj).
- 0.132u3: Mr Goodwraith, Smitdogg and Dumping Union added Mario Bros. (US, Revision F). Fixed rom names. Changed (US, set 1) to clone 'Mario Bros. (US, Revision E)' and clone (US, set 2) to clone 'Mario Bros. (US, Unknown Rev)'. Renamed (mario) to (marioe).

NOTE: Reversed difficulty (MED <-> HARD) reported at 0.106 (and most likely earlier) appears to have been fixed around 0.121, though can only find anecdotal reports and no documented confirmation of this.
      EXERCISE CAUTION! This may or may not be relevant to any future tracks that may be created for this clone, as the difficulty fix was very close to the time this set was added to MAME support.
