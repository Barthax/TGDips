MAME History:
- 0.107u2: Massive cleanup/fixing of 16-bit Sega drivers [Alex Jackson]: Many corrections to descriptive set names, adding revision letters, cabinet types, etc. Fixed visible area in Hang-On hardware. Fixed many dipswitches and added PORT_DIPLOCATION support. Adjusted min/max values for analog controls to improve response. Cleaned up a number of ROM names and fixed some incorrect guesses. Actually disabling 8751 in games that have a fake replacement. Hooked up 8255 PPI correctly now that it has mode 2 support. Fixed behavior of NMI line in later sega sound boards. Fixed addressing in the SegaPCM sound system. Some hardware/documentation cleanup.
