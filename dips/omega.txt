Omega
-----
Note: not currently represented on TG.
ROM set changed: no.  Added in 0.183.
0.183-0.240: omega - "Omega"

From MAMEINFO.DAT [omega]:
- 0.183: ShouTime, Darksoft, Anonymous Donator, Smitdogg and The Dumping Union added 'Omega' (Nihon System 1986). Decrypt Omega program. Used known plaintext attack to obtain Omega program encryption key [Vas Crabb]. Fill in dipswitches for Omega. Get Omega working [Brian Troha]. Fixed sprite rom load order in Omega, sprite colors are now correct to real machine screenshots. Made input ports derived from gigas rather than fully redefining everything. Note: Omega code/gfx looks to be based on Gigas Mark II, given the "MarkII" graphic in the gfx roms and Gigas Mark II style continue numbers etc. PCB is marked "K.K NS6102-A" and seems to be somewhere between Gigas hardware and Free Kick hardware (3x dipswitch arrays). Supposedly an extremely limited release with ~10 PCBs produced [Lord Nightmare].
