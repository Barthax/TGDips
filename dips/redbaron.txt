MAME History:
- 0.146u1: Andrew Welburn and The Dumping Union added clone Red Baron. Changed parent description to 'Red Baron (Revised Hardware)'. Couriersud fixed bad POKEY sound in Red Baron (wrong address_map_entry). Added address decoding PROM to Red Baron. Currently not used in emulation but we archive it anyways [The Dumping Union]. Fixed rom names.
