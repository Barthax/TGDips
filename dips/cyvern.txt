MAME History:
- 0.125u5: Suprnova updates [David Haywood]: Now uses its own draw roz function, which supports linescroll or columnscroll, and will give us the ability to 'render' priority data (with roz applied) from the flagsmap to a temp bitmap to work with. Priorities should be correct from start to end in cyvern now... still not perfect tho. Added a note about what needs fixing for the sengekis sprite zoom (shrink flag we're not handling). Allow wraparound to be turned off (sarukani...). Changed VSync to 59.597100 Hz.
- 0.141u3: Added Cyvern (US). Renamed (cyvern) to (cyvernj).
- 0.191: Changed description to 'Cyvern - The Dragon Weapons (US)' and clone (Japan) to 'Cyvern - The Dragon Weapons (Japan)'.
