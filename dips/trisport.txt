Service Mode:
Service Mode reflects the local configuration after playback ends, not the recording.  Service Mode is accessed with the Service button (F2) but is not a DIP switch itself despite being in the DIP switch portion of the MAME UI.  Navigation is performed with P1 Button 2; selection with P1 Button 1.
