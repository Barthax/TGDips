ROM set changed: yes
0.106-0.147: headonb - "Head On (1 player)"
0.147u4-0.175: headon1 - "Head On (1 player)"

MAME History:
- 0.147u4: ANY, hap and The Dumping Union added 'Head On (bootleg on dedicated hardware)'. Added some notes (sound and other ports) [Robbbert]. Note: Italian bootleg of Head On, by EFG Sanremo (late 70s to early 80s). The game title is unknown. Someone wrote FOOL RACE on a piece of tape on the PCB, but that's not really credible. It's on much cheaper hardware than the original: 8080 instead of Z80, and less RAM needed with the gfx tiles being on ROM. Renamed (headonb) to (headon1).
