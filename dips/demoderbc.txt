MAME History:
- 0.148u2: Brian Troha and The Dumping Union added Demolition Derby. Added the "full" version of Demolition Derby that is dipswitch selectable between Upright and Cocktail mode. The other version was a only supported Cocktail mode. Also added proper dipswitch settings for the Cocktail mode only version [Brian Troha]. Changed 'Demolition Derby' to clone 'Demolition Derby (cocktail)' and clone '(2-Player Mono Board Version)' to 'Demolition Derby (MCR-3 Mono Board Version)'. Renamed (demoderb) to (demoderbc). Replaced M6809 CPU3 with M6809E.
