Service Mode:
Service Mode is accessed via DIP switch with the Service button (F2) used as a toggle.  A reset is required to access and exit the Service Mode so cannot be recorded in an INP file.  Service Mode presents a test screen which is progressed with P1 Start button and then follows an input test screen only.  The DIP switches are represented on the input test screen as the lower pair of binary values.
