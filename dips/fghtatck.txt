Service Mode:
Hardware DIP settings (like Service Mode) will reflect the local configuration after playback ends, not the recording. Most settings are software settings (stored in NVRAM), not hardware. Service Mode is accessed using the Service DIP switch which can be toggled with the Service button (F2).  Navigation is performed with P1 Up & Down; selection with P1 Button 1.
