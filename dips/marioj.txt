MAME History:
- 0.119u1: Stephane Humbert added Mario Bros. (US, set 1). Fixed dipswitches. Changed (US) to clone 'Mario Bros. (US, set 2)'. Renamed (mario) to (marioo) and (mariojp) to (marioj).
- 0.189: Identified clone (Japan) as Revision C [Corrado Tomaselli]. Changed description of clone (Japan) to 'Mario Bros. (Japan, Revision C)'.

NOTE: Reversed difficulty (MED <-> HARD) reported at 0.106 (and most likely earlier) appears to have been fixed around 0.121, though can only find anecdotal reports and no documented confirmation of this.
      EXERCISE CAUTION! There is no note in the track rules that this is relevant to the Japanese sets, but it may well be.
