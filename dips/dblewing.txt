MAME History:
- 0.106u3: Brian Troha, Guru and Yasuhiro Ogawa updated dipswitches in Double Wings. These dips are read using the protection, thus they don't currently have the stated effect on the game as the protection is not implemented right now. Also the Original PCB showed the title screen in English, and the current implementation shows it in Korean(?), so it is likely there is a Language dip/jumper setting. Added 'Coin A/B', 'Flip Screen', 'Lives', 'Difficulty', 'Bonus Life', 'Allow Continue' and 'Demo Sounds'.
- 0.128u4: Angelo Salese fixed several protection issues with Double Wings, improved video and sound. Added 'Territory' dipswitch.
- 0.150: Charles MacDonald and David Haywood fixed Double Wings - Game now playable. Started integrating DECO104 findings from Charles, done a preliminary hookup of Double Wings to it (input ports bit order not yet verified). Nuked old bad simulation code for DW. Misc cleanups [Charles MacDonald, David Haywood]. Added Guru README / clocks [David Haywood]. Fixed 'Lives' dipswitch [lain]. Changed Z80 CPU1 clock speed to 3580000 Hz, OKI6295 sound to 1MHz and VSync to 58.443 Hz. Removed dipswitches '2' and 15x 'Unknown'.
- 0.223: Jorge Silva added clone Double Wings (set 2). Changed parent description to 'Double Wings (set 1)'. Renamed (dblewinga) to (dblewingb).
