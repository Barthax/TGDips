MAME History:
- 0.106u3: Added 'Bonus Life' dipswitch and changed 'Unknown' to 'Unused' dips.

NOTE:
Rules created for 0.106 have all Unknowns left at the default setting of "Off".
In 0.106u3, one of these DIPs was corrected to be the Bonus Life setting.
Therefore, for backward compatibility, Bonus Life setting in 0.107+ must be changed to "None" (note that this is NOT the default setting).
