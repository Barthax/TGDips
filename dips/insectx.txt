ROM set changed: no
0.106-0.205: insectx - "Insector X (World)"

From MAMEINFO.DAT:
- 0.128u1: Changed 'Unknown' to 'Unused' dipswitches.
- 0.143u8: Kanikani fixed difficulty DIPSW (based on manual) and added DIP locations to Insector X.

From tnzs.c:
  - This game doesn't use standard settings for "Difficulty" Dip Switch :
    look at table at 0x1b86 (4 * 2 bytes) and especially table at 0x4731
    (4 bytes) which determines end of level boss energy via code at 0x46e2,
    and you'll notice that "Easy" and "Hard" settings are swapped.
    End of level boss energy is stored at 0xe484 and 0xe485 (LSB first).

Resolution, 0.106-0.205: 256x224 @ 60.000000Hz
