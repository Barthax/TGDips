ROM set changed: yes
0.106-0.191: grudge - "Grudge Match (prototype)"
0.192-0.239: grudgep - "Grudge Match (v00.80, prototype)"

MAME History:
- 0.192: Vernimark and f205v added Grudge Match (v00.90, Italy, location test?). Note: Dump is a bit odd, 2 roms were identical, one rom needs to be loaded over the end of another as not to get corrupt text. I've asked for verification. Despite being in Italian this is a newer and noticably more complete version than the previous set, so I've made it the parent [David Haywood]. Changed (prototype) to clone 'Grudge Match (v00.80, prototype)'. Renamed (grudge) to (grudgep).
