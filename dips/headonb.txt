Note: two ROM sets represented here with changeover at 0.147u4.

MAME History:
- 0.147u4: ANY, hap and The Dumping Union added 'Head On (bootleg on dedicated hardware)'. Added some notes (sound and other ports) [Robbbert]. Note: Italian bootleg of Head On, by EFG Sanremo (late 70s to early 80s). The game title is unknown. Someone wrote FOOL RACE on a piece of tape on the PCB, but that's not really credible. It's on much cheaper hardware than the original: 8080 instead of Z80, and less RAM needed with the gfx tiles being on ROM. Renamed (headonb) to (headon1).
- 0.222: Changed 'Head On (bootleg on dedicated hardware)' from a clone of 'Head On (2 players)' to parent 'Fool Race'. Note: Fool Race is an Italian imitation of Head On, by EFG Sanremo, it's not a bootleg. The game title is Fool Race, confirmed by one of the programmers. It's on much cheaper hardware than the original [Osso, hap]. Added 'Lives' dipswitch. Fixed rom names. Renamed (headonb) to (foolrace).
