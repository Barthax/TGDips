NOTES:
All relevant rules are covered by internal settings.  If not shown during playback, use F2 to access after playback completed.
EEPROM was added to ROMset at 0.194, and as a result, default internal settings have changed! Please exercise caution!
After revealing 100% of each model (unless Back Type is set to None), you are able to switch games - this is disallowed.
