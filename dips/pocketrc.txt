NOTE: The rule sets for these tracks contain both DIPs & internal settings.
However, it appears that in later versions, you can't return to game mode after entering Service Mode [F2], so I'm not sure how anyone could play with altered internal settings.
While in earlier versions, the game runs too fast and wasn't really playable - fixed in 0.143u5.
