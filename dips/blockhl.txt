Service Mode:
Service Mode will reflect the local configuration after playback, not the recording.  Service Mode is accessed using the DIP switch which is toggled with the Service button (F2) and then requires a reset, so cannot be recorded in an INP.  Screens in Service Mode are cycled through using the combination of P1 Start button and P2 Start button.
