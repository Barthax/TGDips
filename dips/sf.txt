Note: two ROM sets represented here with changeover at 0.155.

MAME History:
- 0.155: Changed 'Street Fighter (World, Analog buttons)' to clone 'Street Fighter (World, pneumatic buttons)' and clone Street Fighter (US, set 1) to parent. Small cleanup. Added DIP locations and analog buttons to (World, pneumatic buttons), removed the fake ones. Note: Timing is a matter of tenth-seconds. Tapping the button too lightly/quickly, will not trigger an attack, same as on the original cab. Similarly, holding the button for too long won't register either, analogous to the original cab by pushing the button down slowly instead of hammering it [hap]. Changed 'Unknown' dipswitches to 'Unused'. Renamed (sf) to (sfan) and (sfu) to (sf).
