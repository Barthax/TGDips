Note: two ROM sets represented here with the changeover at 0.246.

MAME History:
- 0.246: anonymous added Avengers (US, revision C) and clone Avengers (US). Correct rom labels for Avengers sets [Brian Troha]. Added info on the Avengers protection chip. Note: The protection chip underneath the sound module. Needs dumping. The protection is extensive: Palette data, calculates player movement and even a hand in the sound. The angle/movement stuff isn't 100% accurate either [simzy39]. Added NO_DUMP placeholder for MCU [hap]. Changed (US set 1) to clone 'Avengers (US, unknown revision)' and clones (US set 2) to 'Avengers (US, revision A)' and (Japan) to 'Hissatsu Buraiken (Japan, revision A)'. Renamed (avengers) to (avengersc) and (avengers2) to (avengersa).

Service Mode:
Service Mode reflects the local configuration after playback ends, not the recording. Service Mode is accessed by enabling the Service Mode DIP switch which can be toggled by the Service button (F2). A reset must be used to enter Service Mode and therefore cannot be recorded in an INP.  Service Mode presents red-only visualisation of the DIP switches and input testing only.
