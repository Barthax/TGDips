Note: do not check Service Mode after playback as the settings will reflect the local configuraton, not that of the INP file.  Service Mode is accessed by enabling the Service DIP switch (can be done via Service button - F2) and then reset the machie so cannot be recorded.  Once in Service Mode, use P1 Start button to move on past the first screen to the button test screen.  DIP switches are shown at the bottom of the screen (in reverse order to MAME's UI depiction).
