NOTE: Use Service Mode (F2) to check settings after playback.  Use Select (F1) briefly to navigate and hold Select (F1) to choose an option.  This also enables checking the hardware dip switches via DIP switches option.
NOTE: Altering SW5, SW7 & SW8 has no effect on INP - this also follows through when checking via Service Mode.
