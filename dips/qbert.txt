NOTES:
Use Service Mode (F2) to check internal settings "OPTIONS/PARAMETERS" settings after playback.  Use Select (F1) briefly to navigate and hold Select (F1) to choose an option.
However this cannot be used to verify DIP SWITCHES used in the INP, as doing so after playback will only display your local DIP settings - use hexdump or inpview as usual.
Altering SW5, SW7 & SW8 has no effect on INP - this also follows through when checking via Service Mode.
