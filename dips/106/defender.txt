NOTES:
All relevant rules are covered by internal settings. With no previous NVRAM (as required by TG), game should start in Service Mode. Note internal settings at the start of the game!!! Much easier than checking after recording ends!
To exit Service Mode, you must cycle through the menu items in ASCENDING order.

[F2] will cycle through menu items in descending order
[F1]+[F2] will cycle through in ascending order
[9] will change values

To enter Service Mode from Game Mode, press [F1]+[F2]. Pressing [F2] alone will enter System Tests.
