MAME History:
- 0.127u6: Stephane Humbert reworked Gee Bee INPUT_PORTS definitions by using conditional dipswitches. Added INPUT_PORTS definition for clone Gee Bee (F.lli Bertolino license), this game has specific "Replay" settings (this fixed unable to coin - always coin lockout). Replaced 'Lives/Bonus Life' dipswitch with 'Lives' and 'Replay'.
- 0.141u3: Changed description to 'Gee Bee (Japan)' and clones (F.lli Bertolino license) to 'Gee Bee (Europe)' and (Gremlin) to 'Gee Bee (US)'.
