MAME History:
- 0.79u1: Nicola Salmoria added Galaga (Namco rev. B) and clone (Midway set 2). Galaga uses now better dumps of the PROMs, with the unused top 4 bits set to 0. Removed Galaga (bootleg) (galagab2 - mix 'n match of ROMs from other sets), Galaga '84 (galaga84 - copyright/gfx change), Nebulous Bee (nebulbee - copyright/name change) and Galaga (fast shoot) (galagads - 1-byte hack to get fast shoot). Changed Z80 CPU1/2/3 clock speeds to 3072000 Hz. Added Namco 54XX (1536000 Hz) sound. Removed sample 'init.wav' and 3rd coin slot. Renamed (galaga) to (galagao).

Note 1: Settings are shown (very briefly) during boot up around frame 700.
Note 2: The player can use Service Mode (F2) DURING RECORDING to show the settings.  It is not possible to confirm the settings AFTER PLAYBACK has ended as MAME reverts to the localised configuration.
