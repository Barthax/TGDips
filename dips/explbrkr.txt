Service Mode:
Hardware DIP settings (like Service Mode) will reflect the local configuration after playback ends, not the recording. Most settings are software settings (stored in NVRAM), not hardware. Service Mode is accessed using the Service DIP switch followed by a reset.  Exiting Service Mode seems to only be possible with a Reset and so cannot be recorded in an INP.  Navigation is performed with P1 Up & Down; selection with P1 Button 1.
