MAME History:
- 0.127u1: Corrado Tomaselli added clone Ikari Warriors (US). SNK rewrite [Nicola Salmoria]: Fixed sprite-sprite priorities. Removed ROM patches, simulated "hard flags" behaviour, oroper memory maps, fixed color test in clone (Japan). fixed inputs and added DIP locations etc. Removed NO_COCKTAIL flag since the game don't have a flip screen dipswitch. This fixes the title and high score screen do not have a black background, as MAME displays. Changed parent description to 'Ikari Warriors (US JAMMA)' and clone (Japan bootleg) to 'Ikari (Joystick hack bootleg)'.
